                      	     Instruction Manual


The compile command has to be issued with non-preempt-29383412.c and preempt-29383412.c being in the same directory as the terminal. And all
the other commands have to issued with the terminal being in the same directory as the compiled non-preempt-29383412.c and preempt-29383412.c.  
Before these programs can run it must be compiled into an executable file. Using the Linux virtual machine, the below commands should compile the programs
	gcc non-preempt-29383412.c -o non-preempt-29383412 process-visualiser
	gcc preempt-29383412.c -o preempt-29383412 process-visualiser
NAME          
       non-preempt-29383412- Pseudo FCFS scheduler
SYNOPSIS          
      iol -- ./non-preempt-29383412 [file]…


DESCRIPTION         
	
	Read process information from process-data file if no other argument is given. This file needs to be run using iol otherwise it will throw errors.
This simulates how a FCFS scheduler would function. An assumption hasa been made that when the scheduler intitates a process it goes to sleep and doesnt take part 
in any activity.

Example
	iol - -./non-preempt-29383412
	Takes data from default file
	
	iol - -./non-preempt-29383412 fil.txt
	Takes data from given file




NAME          
       preempt-29383412- Pseudo RR scheduler
SYNOPSIS          
      iol -- ./non-preempt-29383412 [file]…


DESCRIPTION         
	
	Read process information from process-data file if no other argument is given. This file needs to be run using iol otherwise it will throw errors.
This simulates how a Round Robin scheduler would function. An assumption hasa been made that when the scheduler intitates a process it goes to sleep and doesnt take part 
in any activity.

Example
	iol - -./preempt-29383412
	Takes data from default file
	
	iol - -./preempt-29383412 fil.txt
	Takes data from given file
